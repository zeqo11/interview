# Python Coding Exercise

Your task is to build a python script to gather data from the US Government's vehicle recall data API, and save that data into S3. 

The page for the API is here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/recalls-data

This could be thought of as a step in a DAG. If you want to use local-stack to save data into a “local S3” that’s ok, otherwise pseudocode to represent the S3 upload is fine. Also acceptable is writing out files to the local filesystem in whatever directory structure you would use for S3.

### Requirements
- Retrieve the API data in the script using the provided API key
    - `I1cUnaR54kWoVRYUKn4cTruYulaUWDbIYuY7ByBo`
    - Instructions on API key usage here: https://api.data.gov/docs/developer-manual/
- Data should be saved in Parquet format
- Recalls should be stored with 1 file for each year, named {year}.parquet
    - We want to save the following columns in our files in S3:
        - Id
        - created_at
        - updated_at
        - report_received_date
        - nhtsa_id
        - recall_link (stored as a string of just the link)
        - manufacturer
        - subject
        - component
        - mfr_campaign_number
        - recall_type
        - potentially_affected
        - defect_summary
        - consequence_summary
        - corrective_action
        - fire_risk_when_parked
        - do_not_drive
        - completion_rate
- Store the following aggregations:
    - Number of recalls per manufacturer per year
    - Number of recalls per component per year
    - Number of recalls per type per manufacturer
